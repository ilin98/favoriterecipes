        <p>Asian cuisine comes in all sorts of shapes, colors, textures, and tastes. And frankly, dishes have evolved through generations as modern chefs have paved the way through culinarty and diverse flavors of popular fusion dishes (see Korean bulgogi tacos, sushirritos, and almost everything on the Panda Exrpress menu).</p>
        <p>But what is it that reminds us of traiditonal korean dishes when we have kimchi enchiladas or satisfies our cravings for chinese food when we have orange chicken?</p>
        <p>Well, each cuisine contains essential ingredients that are foundational to that authentic taste that we all enjoy so much. Let's take a look to see what those are.</p>

        <h2><strong>Japanese</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Shoyu (Soy Sauce)</strong> - Traditionally, soy sauce is made by fermenting cooked soybeans and wheat for multiple months up to years, but you can find a similar alternative that tastes just same.</p>
        <p><strong>Miso (Fermented Bean Paste)</strong> - Miso provides a deep savory umami taste that provides the heartiness to soups and stew.</p>
        <p><strong>Sake (Rice Alcohol)</strong> - Often also referred to as rice wine, sake is used to provide all sorts of flavors. As the alcohol evaporates during the cooking process, you will be left with a product that provides acidity, tempers strong odors, tenderizes foods, and balances flavors.</p>
        <p><strong>Mirin (Sweetened Rice Wine)</strong> - Mirin is traditionally made with sweet rice, but in stores around the US, they are typically made with regular rice. However, it has a similar almost honeyed sweetness. Mirin can provide a balancing weetness and glaze in your dishes.</p>
        <h2><strong>Chinese</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Sesame Oil</strong> - Sesame oil is one of the more recognizable flavors of Chiense cooking. It provides a dark color and a rich aroma that adds a nutty flavor to you dishes.</p>
        <p><strong>Shaoxing Wine</strong> - Shaoxing Wine is a type of rice wine from the Shaoing region of China. The vast majority of Chinese recipes call for Shaoxing wine.</p>
        <p><strong>Oyster Sauce</strong> - This dark sauce provides umami flavor that really elevates the taste of any Chinese dish. It will add sweetness and depth to your dish.</p>
        <p><strong>Garlic, Ginger, and Scallions</strong> - These ingredients are essential. These provide the aroma and fragrance needed to cook up any Chinese dish. Be sure to have these ingredients stocked up if you're planning to try out any new Chinese recipes.</p>
        <h2><strong>Korean</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Gochujang (Hot Pepper Paste</strong> - Gochujang is a bright red, chile paste that is commonly used in Korean dishes. It provides sweet and spice.</p>
        <p><strong>Doenjang (Korean Fermented Soybean Paste</strong> - This paste is slightly more mungent than miso, but has a simliar salty, umami flavor that gives tofu, soups, and vegetables that extra depth.</p>
        <p><strong>Gochugar (Ground Chili Pepper Flakes)</strong> - Gochugaru is made of coarsely ground, sun-dried red peppers and are spicy with a hint of sweet.</p>
